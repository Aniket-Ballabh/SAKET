    <div class="i1" id="e1"> Training gyms offer large group, small group or semi-private, one-on-one training or any combination of the three, in a smaller space than that of a membership gym. Anywhere from 1000 sqft to over 10,000 sqft. These gyms often do not have access membership
        nor do they have much in terms of cardio equipment. Training gyms focus on the training, so like most other training based gyms like CrossFit or boot camps, you will not have a membership unless you are getting coached. This is a blanket description
        and there are many variations within this category. Training gyms typically will offer some form of a trial so you can try out the gym before you commit to a longer term program. <br> This is my review of the different types of gyms that are out
        there to help you reach your fitness goals. Let me know what you think or if you want to know more about what I think,feel free to email me any questions you might have. This is all in an effort to help you find the right gym for you.
